A free graduate Econometrics textbook
=====================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free textbook/research monograph on Econometrics suitable for teaching
a PhD core course and make it available through the
[GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

The project is just getting started and is in version 0.1.1
(pre-alpha). Use at your own risk!

Development Notes
-----------------

* The `latex-shared` and `tufte-latex` subdirectories are shared
  across several projects.  Please do not submit patches that contain
  changes to those directories.  If you think that you need to edit
  those files, please propose your changes on the project mailing
  list.  The "original" sources of those directories can be found on
  the EFL project's GitHub page.

* To generate pdfs, run the command `make` in the top-level directory
  of this project (you'll need to have `make` installed, obviously).

* Please email the mailing list if you run into problems or have any
  other questions.

More information
----------------

There are two "best" ways of contacting us.  The first is through the
mailing list for the
[Econometrics Free Library](http://www.econometricslibrary.org),
<econometricslibrary@librelist.com> (this is the mailing list for our
parent project); the [Librelist homepage](http://librelist.com/) has more information about sending messages to this discussion list and [archives are available online as well](http://librelist.com/browser/econometricslibrary/).  The second is by
[filing an issue report for the project](https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/GraduateText/issues/new).

If you find an error in the text, please let us know through one of
those methods.  If you'd like to contribute to this project, please
subscribe to the mailing list.

Thanks!
